# Roadmap

These are some of the functions we are working on implementing in the near future. 

- npm command `create-paella-app`: allows to create a basic npm project from several templates (vanillajs, React, Svelte, etc.).
- New hierarchical pop-up navigation system: the various child pop-ups will be integrated in the same window, with a navigation system with a back button. In the pop-up buttons, you will be able to choose the navigation system you want to use.

Note: The order may vary and new functions with higher priority may appear.
