# Roadmap

These are some of the functions we are working on implementing in the near future. 

- Adding unit tests for `paella-core` public APIs.
- npm command `create-paella-app`: allows to create a basic npm project from several templates (vanillajs, React, Svelte, etc.).
- WebGL video canvas: needed to support other video canvas, such as video 360ยบ.
- Dynamically created button plugin groups: it will not be necessary to create a ButtonGroup plugin to define a new button group.
- Native HLS option for Safari in macOS and iPad: an option to force Safari to use the native HLS player, instead of hls.js
- Save the last known playback time for each video identifier.
- Save the last video quality option selected by the user

Note: The order may vary and new functions with higher priority may appear.
